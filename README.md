The project contains 5 games:


1. Game "Check for parity" (brain-even). The essence of the game is this: the user is shown a random number. And he needs to answer "yes" if the number is even, or "no" if it’s odd.

2. Game "Calculator" (brain-calc). The essence of the game is as follows: the user is shown a random mathematical expression, for example 35 + 16, which must be calculated and the correct answer written down.

3. "Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)" game (brain-gcd). The essence of the game is as follows: the user is shown two random numbers, for example, 25 50. The user must calculate and enter the greatest common divisor of these numbers.

4. "Arithmetic progression game" (brain-progression). We show the player a series of numbers forming an arithmetic progression, replacing any of the numbers with two dots. The player must determine this number. Progression length – 10 numbers. The position of the hidden element changes each time (selected randomly).

5. Game "Is the number prime?" (brain-prime). The essence of the game is this: the user is shown a random number. And he needs to answer "yes" if the number is prime, or "no" if it’s odd.


Minimum system requirements: operating system that supports the command line ubuntu or its emulator.
